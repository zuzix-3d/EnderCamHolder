## Printing

We recommend to print it from PET-G filament, witch 10% infill and 0.16 layer height. Motor cover needs support from inside, but it is easy to remove it.

## Instalation

1. Remove 4 screws from motor cover. Beware, this screws are holding X axis motor.
2. Disconnect X axis end-switch cable
3. Unsrew 2 screws holding end-switch
4. Install end-switch to new motor cover
5. Connect back cable
6. Put new cover back to your printer and screw in 4 screws back

7. Put on angled arm
8. Install camera holder which should be shipped with your camera
9. Install camera

**Enjoy your new camera mount and time/octolapses**

## Happy 3d printing :)
